## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-RESTful, Flask-SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Storage**: Cloudinary for image hosting and management
- **Email Service**: SendGrid for email handling and notifications

## Setup Instructions 

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DZalim/recipeAppFlask.git
    cd recipe-api
    ```

2. **Install Requirements**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Create a `.env` File**:
    - In the project root, create a `.env` file with the following keys:
      ```plaintext
        DB_USER=postgres
        DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD
        DB_PORT=YOUR_PORT
        DB_NAME=YOUR_DB_NAME
        SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
        CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
        CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
        CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
        SENDGRID_API_KEY=YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY
        EMAIL_SENDER=YOUR_EMAIL_SENDER
      ```

4. **Configure Cloudinary**:
   - Register at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) to get API credentials.
   - Add your Cloudinary API credentials to the `.env` file.

5. **Configure SendGrid**:
   - Sign up at [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) to obtain an API key.
   - Add your SendGrid API key to the `.env` file`.

6. **Run Migrations**:
   - BE SURE YOU ARE CONNECTING TO AN EXISTING DATABASE
   - Use Flask-Migrate to create and apply database migrations:
    ```bash
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
    flask db upgrade
    ```

8. **Start the Server**:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

9. **Test API**: After starting the server, you can interact with the API via HTTP requests or using tools like Postman. Refer to the Endpoints section for specific routes and request methods.

  ## Validation & Error Handling

- **User Registration**: Enforces unique constraints on `username` and `email`, requires password strength validation, and checks required fields (`first_name`, `last_name`).
- **Profile Updates**: Validates that only certain fields (`first_name`, `last_name`, `phone`) can be modified by the user.
- **Photo Uploads**: Restricts each user to one profile photo and allows a one-to-many relationship for recipe photos.
- **Access Control**: Ensures users can only modify their own data, with role-based access for certain routes (e.g., only admins can manage categories).
- **Error Messages**: Provides consistent error handling across endpoints, with HTTP status codes like:
  - `401 Unauthorized`
  - `403 Forbidden`
  - `404 Not Found`
  - Includes descriptive messages for each error type.
